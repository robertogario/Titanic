Testing machine learning on Kaggle's Titanic dataset, to predict who survived the Titanic disaster based on data about them such as age, class of travel, gender, etc.

So far the best result is around 77% on Kaggle.

To take this further, exploring relationships between survival rates of family members (using common surnames) would be an option.

See the file titanic_nb.ipynb for the full Jupyter notebook.
