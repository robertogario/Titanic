Testing machine learning on Kaggle's Titanic dataset, to predict who survived the Titanic disaster based on data about them such as age, class of travel, gender, etc.

So far the best result is around 80.4% on Kaggle, which is around the top 7% of scores.

Next steps could be to look for more relationships in the data and see if it can be used to improve the score further.
