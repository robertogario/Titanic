Testing machine learning on Kaggle's Titanic dataset, to predict who survived the Titanic disaster based on data about them such as age, class of travel, gender, etc.

So far the best result is around 78.4% on Kaggle, which is around the top 30% of scores.

Next steps could be to try an ensemble technique, with multiple different classifiers voting on survival rates.
